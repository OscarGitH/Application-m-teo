# Vue.JS Weather App

## Description

This web application, developed using Vue.JS, displays weather forecasts for a city entered by the user. It retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and provides advanced weather information such as humidity, wind speed, minimum and maximum temperature, and atmospheric pressure. It also displays weather forecasts for the next 5 days.

The application has been upgraded from a previous version developed using HTML5, JavaScript, and JQuery to now utilize the Vue.JS framework. This has introduced new features such as data binding, conditional rendering, and list rendering.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to introduce the concepts of the Vue.JS JavaScript framework. The application was initially developed in a previous project and has been evolved to use the mechanisms of Vue.JS.

## Vue.JS Framework

The application now interacts with the weather API using Vue.JS and manipulates the view with a Vue.JS application (bindings, conditions, loops, etc.). It also has the ability to show/hide advanced weather information (humidity, wind, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, atmospheric pressure) and display forecasts for the next 5 days.
